Welcome to the Cathedral little one
Inside you'll find my sanctuary and the Gateways to the other Dream Worlds

        +[Is it safe?]
            ->Safe
            
        +[I'm ready]

=== Safe ===
The Cathedral is the only safe haven left in the dream worlds
The nightmares are unable to breach the walls

=== Ready ===
