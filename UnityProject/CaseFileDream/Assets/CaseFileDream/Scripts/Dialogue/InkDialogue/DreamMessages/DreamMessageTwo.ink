Entry 2:
The Treetops are a fascinating area, the autumn leaves seem to fall all the time
The trees never run out of leaves
I spoke to the Woodpecker above who seemed to be stocking up on Tree Nuts for the winter
As it doesn't seem this Dream has a winter time, I left feeling very confused
Or maybe it is the Woodpecker who is confused
